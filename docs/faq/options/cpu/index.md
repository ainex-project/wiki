The CPU backend to be used for emulation.

| **cpu**                            | **string** |
|:-----------------------------------|:----------:|
| The first available. (**default**) |    any     |
| x86_64 architecture                |    x64     |

In all reality, the emulator can only be compiled for one CPU architecture at a time.
This option is completely useless.
