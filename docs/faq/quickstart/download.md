## Where do I download Xenia?
* :xenia:**[Master](https://github.com/xenia-project/release-builds-windows/releases/latest/xenia.zip)**
* :xenia-canary:*[Canary](https://github.com/xenia-canary/xenia-canary/releases/latest/download/xenia_canary.zip)*<br/>
  Xenia Canary is a fork of Xenia with changes not present in master.


**Xenia** is sometimes detected as a virus. Ignore this, as it is a false positive.
