### Project Origin

The project began when ([@benvanik](https://twitter.com/benvanik)) was between
jobs and wanted to hack on something fun. He'd picked up some region-locked
Japanese games when he was visiting Tokyo and was frustrated he couldn't play them
on his 360, so he started researching the 360 homebrew scene. He'd previously
written a [PlayStation Portable emulator](https://code.google.com/p/pspplayer)
and enjoyed it, noticed no one was playing with a 360 emulator, and thought
'what the hell'.

### Why?

Because it's fun!

### Future Plans

None! There's a [roadmap](../roadmap), but the project has largely achieved what
I set out for it to do (waste time building something cool), and now is purely a
passion project in my spare time. In addition to getting some of my favorite
games to play I'm really just hacking to have fun.
