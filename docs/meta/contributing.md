# Xenia Wiki Contribution Guide

<!--- TODO(halotroop2288) --->

## Prerequisites
- Knowledge and a copy of [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account

## Instructions

1.	Clone the [repo](https://github.com/xenia-project/wiki) and open it in your favorite editor.
2.	If your editor creates editor-specific files, add them to the `.gitignore` file.
3.	Write your article using Markdown. The many features of Markdown extensions can be found in the links below.
	If you'd like to use a Markdown extension not listed in [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/xenia-project/wiki/blob/main/mkdocs.yml),
	you may add them to the list. You should ensure compatibility with other articles (so their layout does not
	accidentally change) before your changes are merged.
	- [PyMdown Extensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/arithmatex/)
	- [MkDocs Material Extensions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/extensions/python-markdown-extensions)
4.	Spell-check your article before it is merged.
5.  Submit a pull request to [the wiki repo](https://github.com/xenia-project/wiki/compare)

## Guidelines

1.	***Never*** attach files or links to content that is private to another party.<br/>
	This includes leaked documentation, piracy websites and other pirated content.
2.	If you attach a link to code on :github: GitHub in your article, make sure to get the *permalink.*<br/>
	Attaching links to branches (such as master/main) leads to dead or incorrect links down the road!
