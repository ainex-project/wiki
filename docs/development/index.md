# Contribute to Ainex

So, you want to contribute to Ainex's development?
Here are the steps you'll need to take to get started:

- Have a computer capable of running Ainex, and install the required system components:
    - See [System Requirements](../faq/quickstart/system_requirements.md)
- Learn the language<br/>
    - An often overlooked aspect to newcomers is having an understanding of the language the project is written in.<br/>
    - Ainex uses [C++ 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17) for development.
      If you don't know this language, you may [learn the basics on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c83JEsu350),
      but it may take a while to get a full grasp of it.<br/>
    - In addition, to submit your contributions, you'll need to know how to use [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
      - Here is a [crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc) on Git to help you out.
- Learn to [build Ainex from source](building.md)<br/>
  This step should give you all you need to start developing Ainex with Visual Studio on Windows or Codelite on Linux.
- Follow the [style guide](style_guide.md)<br/>
